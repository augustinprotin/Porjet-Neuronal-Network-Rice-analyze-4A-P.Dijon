# Agricultural Reports Analysis using Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project is designed to assist PhD students in their research by using neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and summarize reports from the French Ministry of Agriculture.  
Its main purpose is to automatically extract insights, detect trends, and compile structured analytical reports to support academic studies in agricultural sciences and related fields.

## Objectives

The project focuses on three primary goals.  
First, to collect and preprocess data by extracting and cleaning textual content from official reports, ensuring it is normalized and structured for analysis.  
Second, to apply neural network models capable of detecting recurring themes, identifying correlations, and highlighting significant information within the data.  
Finally, to automate the generation of analytical summaries that provide thematic overviews, trend analyses, and synthesized conclusions useful for doctoral research.

## Scientific Purpose

This work aims to simplify and accelerate the process of large-scale document analysis in academic contexts.  
By combining deep learning and text analysis, it provides a tool that can handle large document collections, automatically identify relevant insights, and produce concise, structured summaries to support research projects and theses.

## Technologies Used

The project is developed in Python, integrating several key technologies.  
Deep learning models are implemented with TensorFlow or PyTorch to perform text-based analysis tasks.  
Natural language processing is handled using libraries such as Transformers, spaCy, and NLTK.  
For document parsing and data handling, tools like PDFMiner, PyMuPDF, Pandas, and NumPy are used to ensure efficient processing of diverse report formats.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the experimental phase.  
Development is focused on creating a prototype capable of processing a limited dataset of reports, extracting main topics, detecting trends, and generating preliminary analytical summaries.  
Subsequent stages will focus on improving accuracy, scalability, and usability.
