## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   • Extract and clean textual data from official reports (PDF, DOCX, etc.)  
   • Normalize and structure the data for NLP processing  

2. **Neural Network Analysis**  
   • Apply deep learning models to identify key themes, correlations, and recurring topics  

3. **Automated Reporting**  
   • Generate research-ready summaries that include:  
     - Thematic overviews  
     - Temporal or regional trends  
     - Analytical conclusions and insights
